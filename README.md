# Analyzing Algorithm Performance: A Practical Test

In this activity, we'll look at the performance of linear search versus binary search algorithms by comparing execution or run time.

## Activity
- Pick a partner with whom to do this activity. (OPTIONAL: You can also work on it yourself.)
- Fork this repo and clone it to your local IDE.
- Make a copy of this [Algorithms Lab document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xE6VfEzhNB2kBnPvhfmUMQvLK2y71GGJCClOtkuz7aE/edit?usp=sharing) and share it with members in your group.
- On the first tab of the Algorithms Lab document ("`DATA`"), divide the `List Size` column amongst members in your group. They are colour-coded for your convenience. For example, one person could completes the orange and blue rows; one person could complete the green and purple rows.
- For each `List Size` row, run the `SearchTimer` program with the value in your assigned column. You can find the list size value to modify on `L###` of the code.
- Complete the rows by filling in values for `Linear/Binary Average Iterations` and `Linear/Binary Average Time`.

## Follow-Up Questions
Looking at the data, what observations do you notice about the average iterations of the linear search and the list sizes?

Looking at the data, what observations do you notice about the average iterations of the binary search and the list sizes?

Review the results presented in the Linear vs. Binary Chart tab of Algorithms Lab document.  What conclusions can you draw from this chart?

The Step Comparison Chart tab visualizes the differences in execution time from one list size to another.  Review the results  and describe any conclusions you can draw from this chart.
